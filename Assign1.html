<p> Twilight and new friends stop Nightmare Moon from bringing eternal night, 
turning her back into Princess Luna with friendship magic.The ponies share
how they got their cutie marks, showing Rainbow Dash’s Sonic Rainboom secretly
 helped them all.Twilight exposes fake Cadance as Queen Chrysalis, stopping her
  invasion with real Cadance and Shining Armor’s love.</p>

<p>I love My Little Pony because it teaches important lessons about friendship 
and kindness in every episode, helping you become not just a better friend 
but a better person. My favorite character is Pinkie Pie because she stays 
cheerful and optimistic no matter how tough things get. Her positivity reminds 
me that happiness can brighten even the hardest days.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Twilight sparkle-She used to represent the element of Magic and was one of the six Guardians of Friendship.</li>
  <li>Pinkie pie-she works as a baker at Sugarcube Corner in Ponyville and is known for her seemingly random behavior, fourth wall breaks, and tendency to burst into song</li>
  <li>spike- He is Twilight Sparkle's best friend and number one assistant.</li>
  <li>Princess Luna- her jealousy turned more to fear that she would never be accepted because of the monster that she was previously</li>
</ul>
